Capitalization of command line arguments is ignored.

You can specify command line arguments with +[arg][option], -[arg][option],
      -[arg] [option], or -[arg]=[option].
   Notice that there must not be a
      space between the argument and option if you use '+'. I recommend
      that you use '-'.

The format for the antialiasing flag is somewhat different.
   The antialiasing flag may be preceded by either '-' or '+', and it is not
         case sensitive, but its argument must be given after an equals
         sign, with no spaces in between. If no argument is given, a
         default value of 4 is used.

To build:
   $ make

To run with preset configuration:
   $ make run

sample usage:
   $ raytrace -w512 -H=512 -a=4 +Iimagein
